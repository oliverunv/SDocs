Malian authorities of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali emanating 
from the Algiers process."
S/2024/105,Letter dated 26 January 2024 from the Permanent Representative  of Algeria to the United Nations addressed to the President of the  Security Council,"Annex, 2","Algeria takes note of this decision, which is particularly serious for Mali itself; 
for the entire region, which aspires to peace and security; and for the entire 
international community, which has put all its weight and many resources into helping 
Mali return to stability through national reconciliation."
S/2024/105,Letter dated 26 January 2024 from the Permanent Representative  of Algeria to the United Nations addressed to the President of the  Security Council,"Annex, 2","Algeria has a duty to keep the brotherly people of Mali informed. They know 
that Algeria has never failed to work with sincerity, good faith and unwavering 
solidarity towards brotherly Mali for the implementation of the Agreement on Peace 
and Reconciliation in Mali emanating from the Algiers process. The Malian people 
also need to know and be convinced that the long list of reasons given for denouncing 
the Agreement corresponds neither closely nor remotely to truth or reality."
S/2024/105,Letter dated 26 January 2024 from the Permanent Representative  of Algeria to the United Nations addressed to the President of the  Security Council,"Annex, 2","Indeed, it has not escaped anyone’s attention that the Malian authorities have 
been preparing for this decision for a long time. The warning signs over the past two 
years were their near-total withdrawal from the implementation of the Agreement, 
their almost systematic refusal of any initiative to relaunch its implementation, their 
challenge to the integrity of international mediation, their designation of duly 
recognized signatories to the Agreement as terrorist leaders, their request for the 
withdrawal of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission 
in Mali (MINUSMA), the recent intensification of their arms programmes financed 
by third countries and their recourse to international mercenaries."

crisis."
S/2024/105,Letter dated 26 January 2024 from the Permanent Representative  of Algeria to the United Nations addressed to the President of the  Security Council,"Annex, 2","The brotherly people of Mali should know that such unfortunate and ill-advised 
decisions have proven in the past that the military path is the primary threat to the 
unity and territorial integrity of Mali, that it carries within it the seeds of a civil war 
in Mali, that it postpones national reconciliation instead of bringing it closer, and that 
it ultimately constitutes a real threat to regional peace and stability."
S/2024/105,Letter dated 26 January 2024 from the Permanent Representative  of Algeria to the United Nations addressed to the President of the  Security Council,"Annex, 2","Mali still needs peace and reconciliation. It has no need of solutions that, in the
